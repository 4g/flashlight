- Findout the working of pytorch tracer
	- Doing operations on string output from graph().inputs and graph().outputs
- Findout how to find the line and/or the parent class name in the user file for grouping the nodes
	- on Going, merge line and call types together and start writing analysis programs
	- Find the corresponding line for line - graph mapping
	- Find the parent class for grouping
- List out all the modules/classes/functions that needs to be in the graph as a node
- Find and store the inputs and weights
