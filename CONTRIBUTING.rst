We'd love to accept your patches! If you are interested in contributing to FlashLight, send us a pull request.

Working with the team
=====================
If you're planning a larger contribution, please get in touch with the team through a GitHub issue before starting work. We might already started working on it or we might decided to refrain from that particular feature. Discussing it before hand make the process smoother :)

Writing documentation
=====================
FlashLight uses [Google style](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)
for formatting docstrings. Length of line inside docstrings block must be limited to 100 characters

Writing test cases
=================
FlashLight uses pytest for writing test cases. We try to keep the test coverage more than 90%
