FlashLight

The Visualization Tool For Your NeuralNetwork
--------------------------------------

FlashLight is built to make model interpretation easy. Rather than just being a visualization tool we wanted to make a playground for researchers and developers to debug the neural network and playe around with the graph. FlashLight currently supports only PyTorch model visualization but we are tyring to make it compatible with GLUON and TensorFlow eager.
